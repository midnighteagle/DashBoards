🚀 **Power BI Dashboard Project – Madhav Ecommerce Store Sales Analysis**

I recently created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze and visualize the sales performance of **Madhav Ecommerce Store**. 📊

🔍 **Key Features of the Dashboard**:
- Dynamic visuals showing **monthly sales trends**, **top-performing products**, and **customer segmentation**
- Insights into **regional performance**, **category-wise breakdown**, and **sales growth**
- Drill-through pages for deep-dives into product-level and customer-level data
- Applied **DAX measures** and **custom visuals** to enhance decision-making

💡 The goal was to provide actionable insights that can help stakeholders make informed business decisions and optimize marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.
